    "body": "### Go version\n\ngo version go1.19 windows/amd64\n\n### Output of `go env` in your module/workspace:\n\n```shell\nDoes not depend env\n```\n\n\n### What did you do?\n\nI have observed that after creating a large number of Goroutines, the memory does not seem to be released back to the system. Specifically, I suspect there might be an issue with the `sched.gFree.noStack` in proc.go, where the Goroutine structures are not being properly cleared, leading to potential memory leak.\n\n### What did you see happen?\n\nThe memory used by the finished Goroutines does not appear to be released, even when the Goroutines are no longer in use. This suggests a potential memory leak in the runtime's Goroutine management.\n\n### What did you expect to see?\n\nI expected that after Goroutines finish their execution and are no longer needed, the memory they occupied would be returned to the system.",
